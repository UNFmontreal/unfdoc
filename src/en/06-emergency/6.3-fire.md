# Fire Protocol

-   *In the event of a fire in the UNF area, the internal fire brigade will follow the protocol set out by the hospital.*

-   *Once the situation has been identified and confirmed, emergency measures will be followed as per the hospitalâ€™s policies and procedures manual.*

-   *In the UNF area, extra precautions must be taken taking into account the high magnetic field, hospital personnel not familiar with the imaging unit and Emergency Response teams from outside the hospital.*

1. Evacuate the MRI room and lock the doors:
This will prevent someone from entering who may be unaware of
        the dangers of a high field magnet.

2. Evacuate the UNF area:
Participants, visitor and staff must leave the areas to an area not affected by the emergency situation.

3. Assist Emergency Response Personnel:
Depending on the type of emergency, be available to help as needed.

4. Direct Emergency Responder to area needed:
UNF staff know the area better than the Emergency Responder, be available to help as needed.
