*Steps to be followed when planning to submit a project:*

## Project Review

There are four kinds of reviews to which all research projects are submitted.

1.  Scientific Review

2.  Ethics Review

3.  Administrative and institutional propriety evaluation

Once all three evaluations have been done, your project can be approved by the person formally mandated for the CIUSSS in Center-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal. It is only after your project has been approved by the formally mandated person that you are authorized to start your research project.
