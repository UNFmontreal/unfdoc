# MRI compatible glasses

- If a participant needs to see an image or set of instructions during the scanning session (i.e. fMRI task), the participant may need to wear MRI compatible glasses to see the instructions or images.*

- Researchers are responsible for preparing the glasses and returning the lenses and frames to correct place. The MRI compatible glasses must remain in the UNF area.

- For cleaning, use only the solution and cleaning clothes that are provided with these lenses.

- Participants may wear their contact lenses during the MRI scan. 

- Participants can not wear their glasses in the scanner

> MRI compatible glasses are available in range of corrections: +/- 0.5 diopters to +/- 7.5 diopters, in 0.5 diopter increments.
