# Before you start

## Account on the UNF server
In order to use UNF's server at CRIUGM, you need to create an account. 
This account could either be an individual or a team account.

To obtain an account, or for all account-related inquiries, please contact [André Cyr](mailto:andre.cyr@criugm.qc.ca).

## Your space

## Backup your data

As for user accounts on UNF computers (stark, magma), all documents in your $HOME and those in /data are saved on even and odd evenings, respectively. Documents in /scratch are not saved. Note that copies of deleted documents are kept for one month. Meaning, if you created a document in your $HOME, it was saved overnight and you delete it later, you then have a month from the date the file was destroyed to request a restoration before it disappears forever. Restoration requests can be made at <support.unf@criugm.qc.ca>. No action on your part is required to activate backups.
