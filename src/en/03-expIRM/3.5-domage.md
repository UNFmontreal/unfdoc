# Damage to Equipment

1.  UNF management must be informed, at all times, of any equipment taken into the scanner room, whether ferromagnetic or not.

2.  Unless otherwise agreed, any equipment allowed into the scanner room must be mandatorily operated by trained UNF staff who could, under special circumstances, also supervise their installation.

3.  The number of people allowed in the scanner room shall not exceed two, not counting the study participant. If needed, that number could be increased with the express authorization of UNF management.

4.  There must be at all times at least one person present when the participant is in the MRI room!

5. Not following these safety rules could result in damages to UNF equipment and to the people. In that case, the researcher leading the study shall be held responsible of any material repair costs.
